To tackle all these problems, we are here with a set of tools and guidelines to do effective TDD on Android. There are few ways people tried to enable TDD in Android as described below :   * Separate UI layer from logic, and just test logic   * Use a Framework like Roboelectric   * Separate UI layer from logic, write standard Junit test for logic layer and TDD using Instrumentation test framework for activities.We will explain the best out of these approaches - how to Test Drive your app, and the best practices.","Jigish Chawda, Rohini Kulkarni",Pune,Mobile,1,23/15/2013 18:52:36,amanchan@thoughtworks.com,From Mobile web to BlackBerry World - in less than a week!,"With their new OS, BlackBerry has joined the bandwagon of platforms supporting Html5/Js as first class language.
