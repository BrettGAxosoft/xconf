But this is how I relate to it... Yesss it's my first year at TW .....After college...coming to a company, not just a mere company, but a company like Thougtworks, was certainly a major transition for me..TW journey started with its University... Where I met loads of ppl from diff countries, backgrounds and learnt a lot of different things, ofcourse, apart from the company culture...And then now even working on a project which has no client .. no tech leader.. gives you opportunity to explore more and more .... Being a ThoughtWorker, everyone expects a lot... They break you and at the same time they take care that you firmly stand again....In such an environment where I am able to have loads of fun, face bunch of challenges with smart people always around, guiding me at every step, working at their level best to make me versatile and enhance my qualities, then no doubt, opportunity of working together in a team, teaches the fact that some things can be better done and enjoyed together so for me its 'mile sur mera tumhara .......!'",Priti Biyani,Pune,Others,4,23/18/2013 10:26:14,ananthpr@thoughtworks.com,Setting up prod-like networked environments on your laptop using Vagrant and Chef,"Set up a non-trivial environment on your system - A prod-like environment with a public-facing webserver, a private database and then to model the deployment around that setup.
